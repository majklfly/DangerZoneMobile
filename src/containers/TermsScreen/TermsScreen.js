          CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.TermsText}>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile

          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
          technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
          been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
          signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
          choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
          adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about
          that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
